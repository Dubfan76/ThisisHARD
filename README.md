# ThisisHARD

In the next two months, I would like to build software that...

answers a homework question which is the title of the first link that comes up when one looks up that question in Google

e.g. homework question: When was the Gettysburg address?
My software would come up with... November 19, 1863
Also "On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered a short speech at the end of the ceremonies dedicating the battlefield cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. That speech has come to be known as the Gettysburg Address." optionally, if user says 'Y' to the question "Would you want a detailed explanation?"
OR even put an option to gather and compare results from Bing, Yahoo, or other search engines
